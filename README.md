# v1
- Commented out all gyro features
- Building basic move/turnr/turnl functions
- ToDo: implement and practice barebone functions (practice timing), then implement gyro if possible, then implement calibration
- Find wheel ration so we can set all wheel speeds to global variable 'x' and change it at once based on competition target time (another ToDo)
